Data Transformation: Implemented PostgreSQL-specific SQL syntax and functions for data transformation.
Data Integration: Combined multiple data sources into a cohesive data model.
Data Quality: Applied data cleaning techniques to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Project Structure
bronze: Raw data ingestion layer.
silver: Cleaned and transformed data layer.
gold: Analytical and reporting layer.
Technologies Used
Database: PostgreSQL
ETL Process: SQL-based transformations
Data Modeling: Star schema for analytical queries
